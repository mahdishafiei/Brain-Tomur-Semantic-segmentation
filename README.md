### Overview
Brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is a critical task for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome monitoring. This repository provides the code and workflows to reproduce our study comparing **Focal Loss** and **Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss** in training a U-Net model for automatic tumor segmentation.

Our experiments show that **Focal Loss outperforms BCE Loss** in terms of Dice coefficient, precision, recall, and overall segmentation robustness on imbalanced datasets :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### Contributions
- Built and trained **U-Net architecture** with 4 encoding and 4 decoding blocks (*see Figure 1, p.6*).  
- Curated a **dataset of 314 high-resolution brain MRI scans** (sagittal, coronal, axial planes) from 108 patients.  
- Implemented **skull stripping** preprocessing for noise reduction and improved localization (*see Figure 3, p.8*).  
- Compared **loss functions** (BCE vs. Focal Loss) with extensive **hyperparameter tuning** via Ray Tune.  
- Reported evaluation using **Dice (F1), Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and Hausdorff Distance**.

### Results
5-fold cross-validation summary (test data):

| Loss Function | Accuracy | Dice (F1) | Precision | Recall |
|---------------|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Focal Loss** | 99.44%   | **81%**   | **82.92%** | **79.32%** |
| BCE Loss      | 99.03%   | 74.52%    | 76.16%    | 71.9%  |

- Focal Loss improved segmentation by **+6.4% Dice**, **+6.8% Precision**, **+7.4% Recall** compared to BCE.  
- Hausdorff distance with Focal Loss: **95% CI = (43.22mm, 52.92mm)** (*Table 3, p.14*).
